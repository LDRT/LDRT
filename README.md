👋 Hi, I’m @ldrt

👀 I’m a frontend developer. I've been working with Angular for years but I have no preference, vanilla is fine too 🍦

🌱 I’m interested by anything related to the frontend but I aim to be a fullstack dev so I'll be learning some backend (language not defined yet)

✨ Nothing special here, I'll only be saving the code made during trainings, tutorials etc.

ldrt/ldrt is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
