👋 Hi, I’m @ldrt

👀 I’m a frontend developer. I've been working with Angular for years but I have no preference, vanilla is fine too 🍦

🌱 I’m interested by anything related to the frontend but I aim to be a fullstack dev so I'll be learning some backend

✨ Nothing special here, I'll only be saving the code made during trainings, tutorials etc. The code may be incomplete, dirty, non-optimized etc. because I'll follow the lessons as they are. Maybe one day I'll go over them and make them better, maybe not. So, take my repositories with a grain of salt.

<!---
ldrt/ldrt is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
